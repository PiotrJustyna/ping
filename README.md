My variation on PONG game written for Raspberry Pi in ARM assembly language. All hardware designed, assembled and soldered by myself.

***IMPORTANT*** I am not a professional ARM developer and I wrote this project just for fun. Please use the code at your own responsibility. If you spot a bug or something that can be done better, please let me know!
